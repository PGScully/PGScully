# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Peter.

I write mobile apps in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), because I love the potential of writing an app once and having it run on Android, iPhone, Linux, MacOS, Windows, and on the web.  Hopefully we'll get there without too much fuss and bother.

You can find out more about me on my website, [www.peterscully.name](https://wwww.peterscully.name).
